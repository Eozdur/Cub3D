Cub3D is a team project at 42 that tasks us with creating a "3D" game engine using miniLibX. This project is inspired by the world-famous 90's game Wolfenstein 3D, the first-ever FPS. The objective is to delve deeply into the mathematical concepts behind the raycasting algorithm, such as calculating distances, heights, sprite locations, and field of view to create projections primarily using trigonometry.
